        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
                Biryani is a fragrant and flavorful rice dish, originating from the Indian subcontinent. It's typically made with basmati rice, spices, and meat, such as chicken, lamb, or goat, although there are vegetarian variations as well. The ingredients are layered and cooked together, allowing the flavors to meld beautifully. Biryani is often garnished with fried onions, nuts, and fresh herbs, adding texture and depth to each bite.

                <li>Cook the Chicken:
                    <ul>
                        <li>In a deep pan or pot, heat ghee or oil.</li>

                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>Layering:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Take a heavy-bottomed pot or a biryani pot. Spread a layer of partially cooked rice evenly at the bottom.</li>
                        <li>Add a layer of cooked chicken on top of the rice.</li>
                        <li>Sprinkle some chopped mint leaves, coriander leaves, and fried onions.</li>

                        <li>Cook on low heat (dum) for about 20-25 minutes. This allows the flavors to meld together and the rice to fully cook.</li>
