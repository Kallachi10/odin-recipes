        <h3>How to prepare:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare the Rice Flour Mixture:
                    <ul>
                        <li>In a bowl, mix together rice flour, grated coconut, salt, and any desired seasoning spices.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>Boil Water:
                    <ul>
                        <li>In a pot, bring water to a boil. Make sure there's enough water to steam the kuzhimanthi.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>Form the Dough:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Gradually add the boiling water to the rice flour mixture, stirring continuously to form a smooth dough. The consistency should be such that you can easily shape it into balls.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>Shape the Kuzhimanthi:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Take small portions of the dough and roll them into small balls or cylindrical shapes using your hands. Ensure they are compact and well-formed.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>Steam the Kuzhimanthi:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Once the steamer is ready, place the shaped kuzhimanthi onto the greased cavities of the pan, leaving some space between each piece.</li>
                        <li>Cover the steamer with a lid and steam the kuzhimanthi for about 10-15 minutes, or until they are cooked through and firm to touch.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>Serve:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Once cooked, remove the kuzhimanthi from the steamer and let them cool slightly before serving.</li>
                        <li>Kuzhimanthi can be enjoyed on its own or paired with chutney or sambar for added flavor.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
